# Description

<div class="content"><p><span style="font-size: medium">Some brave warriors come to a lost village. They are very lucky and find a lot <br/>
of treasures and a big treasure chest, but with angry zombies. <br/>
The warriors are so brave that they decide to defeat the zombies and then <br/>
bring all the treasures back. A brutal long-drawn-out battle lasts from morning to <br/>
night and the warriors find the zombies are undead and invincible. <br/>
Of course, the treasures should not be left here. Unfortunately, the warriors <br/>
cannot carry all the treasures by  the treasure chest due to the  limitation of  the <br/>
capacity of the chest. Indeed, there are only two types of treasures: emerald and <br/>
sapphire.  All  of  the emeralds  are equal in size and value, and with infinite <br/>
quantities. So are sapphires. <br/>
Being the priest of the warriors with the magic artifact: computer, and given <br/>
the size of the chest, the value and size of each types of gem, you should compute <br/>
the maximum value of treasures our warriors could bring back. </span></p></div>

# Input

<div class="content"><p><span style="font-size: medium">  There are multiple test cases. The number of test cases T (T &lt;= 200) is given <br/>
in the first line of the input file.  For  each test case,  there  is  only one line <br/>
containing five integers N, S1, V1, S2, V2, denoting the size of the treasure chest is <br/>
N and the size and value of an emerald is S1 and V1, size and value of a sapphire <br/>
is S2, V2. All integers are positive and fit in 32-bit signed integers. </span></p>
