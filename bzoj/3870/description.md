<div class="content"><div>There is an old country and the king fell in love with a devil. The devil always asks the king to do some crazy things. Although the king used to be wise and beloved by his people. Now he is just like a boy in love and can’t refuse any request from the devil. Also, this devil is looking like a very cute Loli.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Y*wan still remember the day he first meets the devil. Now everything is done and the devil is gone. Y*wan feel very sad and suicide.</div>
<div></div>
<div>You feel guilty after killing so many loli, so you suicide too.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Nobody survive in this silly story, but there is still some hope, because this is just a silly background story during one programming contest!</div>
<div></div>
<div>And the last problem is:</div>
<div></div>
<div>Given a sequence a_1,a_2,...,a_n, if we can take some of them(each a_i can only be used once), and they sum to k, then we say this sequence is a good sequence.</div>
<div></div>
<div>How many good sequence are there? Given that each a_i is an integer and 0&lt;= a_i &lt;= L.</div>
<div></div>
<div>You should output the result modulo 10^9+7.</div>
<p></p></div>

# Input

<div class="content"><div>The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of the test cases.</div>
<div>For each test case, the first line contains 3 integers n, k, L.</div>
<div></div>
<div>T&lt;=20, n,k&lt;=20 , 0&lt;=L&lt;=10^9.</div>
<p></p></div>

# Output

<div class="content"><div>
<div>For each cases, output the answer in a single line.</div>
</div>
<p></p></div>
