<div class="content"><div>Every year, Farmer John brings his NN cows to compete for &#34;best in show&#34; at the state fair. His arch</div>
<div>-rival, Farmer Paul, brings his MM cows to compete as well (1≤N≤1000,1≤M≤1000).Each of the N+MN+</div>
<div>M cows at the event receive an individual integer score. However, the final competition this year wi</div>
<div>ll be determined based on teams of KK cows (1≤K≤10), as follows: Farmer John and Farmer Paul both </div>
<div>select teams of KK of their respective cows to compete. The cows on these two teams are then paired </div>
<div>off: the highest-scoring cow on FJ&#39;s team is paired with the highest-scoring cow on FP&#39;s team, the s</div>
<div>econd-highest-scoring cow on FJ&#39;s team is paired with the second-highest-scoring cow on FP&#39;s team, a</div>
<div>nd so on. FJ wins if in each of these pairs, his cow has the higher score.Please help FJ count the n</div>
<div>umber of different ways he and FP can choose their teams such that FJ will win the contest. That is,</div>
<div> each distinct pair (set of KK cows for FJ, set of KK cows for FP) where FJ wins should be counted. </div>
<div>Print your answer modulo 1,000,000,009.</div>
<div>
<div>每年农夫约翰都会带着他的N只牛去集会上参加“你是最棒哒“的比赛。他的对手农夫保罗也带了M只牛去参加比赛</div>
<div>(1 ≤ N ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ M ≤ 1000)。每只牛都有自己的分数。两人会选择K只牛组成队伍(1 ≤ K ≤ 10)，两队</div>
<div>牛在按分数大小排序后一一配对，并且约翰打败保罗当且仅当对于每一对牛，约翰的牛分数都比保罗的高。请帮助</div>
<div>约翰计算约翰打败保罗的方案数 mod 1000000009。两种方案不同，当且仅当约翰或保罗选择的牛的集合与另一种</div>
<div>方案不同。</div>
