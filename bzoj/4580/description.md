<div class="content"><div>Bessie likes downloading games to play on her cell phone, even though she does find the small touch </div>
<div>screen rather cumbersome to use with her large hooves.She is particularly intrigued by the current g</div>
<div>ame she is playing. The game starts with a sequence of NN positive integers (2≤N≤248), each in the</div>
<div> range 1…40. In one move, Bessie can take two adjacent numbers with equal values and replace them a</div>
<div> single number of value one greater (e.g., she might replace two adjacent 7s with an 8). The goal is</div>
<div> to maximize the value of the largest number present in the sequence at the end of the game. Please </div>
<div>help Bessie score as highly as possible!</div>
<div><span style="font-family: Helvetica, &#39;Microsoft Yahei&#39;, verdana; font-size: 14px; line-height: 15.549334526062px;">给你n个数，每次可以将两个相邻的相同数x合并成x+1,求最大能合出多少</span></div>

# Input

<div class="content"><div>The first line of input contains N, and the next N lines give the sequence of N numbers at the start</div>
<div> of the game.</div>
<p></p></div>

# Output

<div class="content"><p>Please output the largest integer Bessie can generate.</p>
<p></p></div>

# Sample Input

<div class="content"><span class="sampledata">4<br/>
1<br/>
1<br/>
1<br/>
2</span></div>

# Sample Output

<div class="content"><span class="sampledata">3<br/>
//In this example shown here, Bessie first merges the second and third 1s to obtain the sequence 1 2 2<br/>
, and then she merges the 2s into a 3. Note that it is not optimal to join the first two 1s.</span></div>
